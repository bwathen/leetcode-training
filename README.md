# What?

I use this repository for tracking my leetcode training

# How to use

Run `node problems/<path-to-problem-folder>`

You need to manually put an input in the problem folder.

# Why?

Sometimes the leetcode editor fails out for a call stack exceeding its limit. This is just a way to get around those ambiguous failures. Also VSCode is just nicer to edit in!
